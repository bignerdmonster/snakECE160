# THE PLAN
- none so far lmao
- - we make snake!


IDEAS:
- *his* face as a background
- loop around
- lamaku assignment
- monty hall problem
- ok so like hear me out. we make the playing field render as a sphere. we use chatgpt for this because it would be hard.
- Mirrors? 


# **TODO**

- add collision in Snake.move function? seems most appropriate 
- from there, we ball...
